      "description": "The New Normal has arrived: technology is not 'special' anymore, and digital has become normal. The shift to the New Normal has nothing to do with technology, but the effect of the Network. Digital was just an appetizer. The future has become unpredictable. The new model is VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity. The age of Networks only fuels the aspect of VUCA. Networks set the world of VUCA on fire. When we enter the Networked Age of VUCA, company have a Fluid Strategy: the two crucial elements are Speed and Agility. The age of Networks is the age of Information: information has become the new oil in this new era. Information becomes core, Information becomes valuable. Everyone is in the information business. Core result #1: Markets disappear and become Networks of Information. Marketing becomes learning how to influence networks. Core result #1: When the outside world becomes a Network, the inside of companies has to behave as a Network as well. It takes a Network to Serve a Network. Innovation propagates faster than ever before. Silicon Valley WAS the high-tech capital of the world. It has now become the Industry-Disruption-Capital of the world. The question is NOT 'Are you built to last?'. The question in the age of networks is: \"Can you Adapt and Leverage?\"",

Currently, there is a major disconnect between the multi-year development cycles of automakers and consumer expectations for smart devices. Automakers have challenges to keep pace with the fast-moving software updates brought about by tech companies and the result is a user experience that is vastly outdated for drivers that use a number of smart devices day-to-day. However, while connecting the driver to the cloud is one of the most complex yet thrilling tasks, it won\u2019t be just about recreating or bringing today\u2019s smartphone experience into the car. It will be about fundamentally rethinking what\u2019s possible in the automotive environment.

The field of consumer-related services is long lost to the smartphone world and just needs to be integrated into the car in the most convenient and intuitive way. \r\n\r\nIn the near future, automated driving will offer new possibilities to use the drive time more efficiently. Cars become mobile homes and offices. To prevent from being reduced to the role of mere \u201cproducers\u201d, OEMs need to establish their own ecosystem based on vehicle-related data and services. And they need a partner who enables them to develop new business models together with other, non-automotive market players such as mobility providers, insurances and location-based services.\r\n\r\nThe prerequisite is a vendor-independent data aggregator, capable to securely handle and process complex data.

Just like open platforms have shaped the web, open source hardware has already taken over the small to medium electronics development. In October we announced OSVehicle's TABBY, the first open source framework for the creation of vehicles. How will it change the assumptions in the automotive industry? Why is \"open and distributed\" the new business model, that will inevitably overcome the old centralized approach? The world is changing and for the first time it's truly in our own hands. We'll cover how the automotive industry is evolving and understand where we can play an active role in it.",
