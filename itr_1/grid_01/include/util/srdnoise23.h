 \brief C header file for Perlin simplex noise with rotating
 gradients and analytic derivative over 2 and 3 dimensions.
 \author Stefan Gustavson (stegu@itn.liu.se)
 */

/*
 * This is an implementation of Perlin "simplex noise" over two dimensions
 * (x,y) and three dimensions (x,y,z). One extra parameter 't' rotates the
 * underlying gradients of the grid, which gives a swirling, flow-like
 * motion. The derivative is returned, to make it possible to do pseudo-
 * advection and implement "flow noise", as presented by Ken Perlin and
 * Fabrice Neyret at Siggraph 2001.
 *
 * When not animated and presented in one octave only, this noise
 * looks exactly the same as the plain version of simplex noise.
 * It's nothing magical by itself, although the extra animation
 * parameter 't' is useful. Fun stuff starts to happen when you
 * do fractal sums of several octaves, with different rotation speeds
 * and an advection of smaller scales by larger scales (or even the
 * other way around it you feel adventurous).
 *
 * The gradient rotations that can be performed by this noise function
 * and the true analytic derivatives are required to do flow noise.
 * You can't do it properly with regular Perlin noise.
